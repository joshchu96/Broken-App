# Broken App Issues

-use express.json() to parse the JSON body
-changed the route into a async function
-extracted the developer from body into a variable for cleaner code.
-rewrote the async await axios function to fetch all the data and return one promise when all is completed.
-added a callcback function in app.listen to confirm that the server is running.
